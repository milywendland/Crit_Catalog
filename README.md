## **_Description_**

#### Have you ever wished there was a place where you could keep a list of all of your favorite table top _AND_ video games? Well, with Crit Catalog, you can do just that.

## **_Technologies Used_**

- Mongoose
- Express

## **_Getting Started_**

#### Peruse our catalog of games, leave a review, and add them to your personal fav list. Don't see the game you're looking for? You can submit it to us yourself!

#### I linked my trello board above, in it you can find my ERD and component hierarchy chart.

#### Eventually this project will be deployed onto Heroku!
